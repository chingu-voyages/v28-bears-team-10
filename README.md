# TECHVolunteer :rocket:

TECHVolunteer is designed to connect charities/NFPs to budding developers/designers (volunteers) who can work for the charity on a specific job on an unpaid basis.

## Overview

Budding devs and UX designers can have a profile which is viewable by charities. Charities who need help can search for these volunteers on the volunteers board or they can post a ‘job’ up which the volunteers could contact them about.

This is intended to bridge the gap for aspiring developers/designers between the ’student’ world and the ‘commercial’ world, by getting real-world experience to put on their portfolio.

It is also useful for charities as they can get help without having to pay for it.
